Description: cnvrtwfm is a utility for converting TDS file system .WFM
	and TD 100 .ISF files to other waveform formats.  Formats generated 
	include CURVE? response compatible binary, and ascii and generic 
	spreadsheet mathcad and .WFM files.

Normal Use: cnvrtwfm in it's default usage converts a list of .WFM files
	to .ISF files containing a waveform preamble and a curve in 8
	bit twos complement. Typical usage:

		cnvrtwfm tek00001.wfm	-> creates tek00001.isf
		cnvrtwfm *.wfm		-> creates *.isf (converts all wfms)

Advanced Use: cnvrtwfm has a number of command line flags to facilitate
	custom file output.  These are used on the command line with the
	file list as follows:
		cnvrtwfm [flags] <file list>
	Flags:	-p	include preamble (default)
		-p-	don't include preamble
		-d	include waveform data (default)
		-d-	don't include waveform data
		-8	output 8 bit data (default)
		-8-	output 16 bit data
		-b	binary output format (default)
		-b-	ascii output
		-s	swap bytes (Intel default)
		-s-	don't swap bytes (Motorola)
		-i	show file info on console
		-i-	don't show info (default)
		-r	output raw data only (no preamble no header)
		-r-	don't output raw data only (default)
		-l	output spreadsheet data only (no preamble no header)
		-l-	don't output spreadsheet format (default)
		-m	output mathcad data only (no preamble no header no x)
		-m-	don't output mathcad format (default)
		-w	output wfm files (from .isf input only)
		-w-	don't output wfm files (default)

	Spreadsheet format is a list of comma separated ascii x, y pairs
	where x is the scaled time axis (0 = trigger) and y is the scaled
	vertical axis.  Pairs are delimited by crlf.

	Mathcad data is a list of crlf separated values. If the default
	header is selected, the first 4 values are the record length,
	the time between samples, the trigger position in samples,
	and the jitter of the record in samples. Jitter is expressed as a 
	value between 0 and 1. The header is followed by the data values. 
	If the header is dissabled via the -p- switch, only the data values 
	are output.

Output File Types:	Different output file types are labeled via file
	extension.  The default output file extension is ".ISF". ".ISF"
	files have a waveform preamble and binary curve data. Files in
	spreadsheet or mathcad format are labeled ".DAT", non-spreadsheet 
	files using ascii format are ".ASC", TDS file system compatible 
	files ".WFM", and all other files are ".WAV".
	
	Examples:
		cnvrtwfm -d- -p- -i *.wfm	-> shows file info for all
						files and creates no output
						files.

		cnvrtwfm -l *.wfm		-> creates spreadsheet output
						files *.dat.

		cnvrtwfm -b- tek00001.wfm	-> creates ascii ouput file
						tek00001.asc

		cnvrtwfm -r -8- tek00001.wfm	-> creates output file
						tek00001.wav which consists
						of N 16 bit twos complement
						values where N is the record
						length of the .wfm file.

		cnvrtwfm -w *.isf		-> creates output files *.wfm

Installation:	To install cnvrtwfm copy the cnvrtwfm execuable to a directory
	which is in your path variable.  To display your path variable type
	path <enter> at your command prompt.
